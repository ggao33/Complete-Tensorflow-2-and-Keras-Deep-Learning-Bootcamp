# Complete-Tensorflow-2-and-Keras-Deep-Learning-Bootcamp
This course will guide you through how to use Google's latest TensorFlow 2 framework to create artificial neural networks for deep learning! This course aims to give you an easy to understand guide to the complexities of Google's TensorFlow 2 framework in a way that is easy to understand.

## Section 0-2:
These three sections review numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib for data preprocessing and data visualization. 

## Section 3:
Based on LendingClub DataSet from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club) an ANN model is built to predict whether a borrower will be able to pay back their loan. There are many data preprocessing operation has been done to remove unnecessary features such as emp_length shown below:

## Section 4:
In this section, MNIST, CIFAR are used for training CNN. [Cell images taken from official NIH wensite](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rXrgUzzIdsyJ4xp05Suq7ioR5q1tOtFY) are examples to deal with real image files which feed into the model in batches due to large groups of images. It resizes raw images and train the model to predict which cell is infected or not.

The assessment task is to build an image classifier with Keras and Convolutional Neural Networks for the Fashion MNIST dataset. This data set includes 10 labels of different clothing types with 28 by 28 grayscale images. There is a training set of 60,000 images and 10,000 test images.
