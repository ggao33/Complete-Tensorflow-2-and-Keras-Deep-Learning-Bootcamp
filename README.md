# Complete-Tensorflow-2-and-Keras-Deep-Learning-Bootcamp
This course will guide you through how to use Google's latest TensorFlow 2 framework to create artificial neural networks for deep learning! This course aims to give you an easy to understand guide to the complexities of Google's TensorFlow 2 framework in a way that is easy to understand.

Section 0-2:
These three sections review numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib for data preprocessing and data visualization. 

Section 3:
Based on LendingClub DataSet from Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club) an ANN model is built to predict whether a borrower will be able to pay back their loan. There are many data preprocessing operation has been done to remove unnecessary features.
