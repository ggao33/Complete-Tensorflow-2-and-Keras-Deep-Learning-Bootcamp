# Complete-Tensorflow-2-and-Keras-Deep-Learning-Bootcamp
This course will guide you through how to use Google's latest TensorFlow 2 framework to create artificial neural networks for deep learning! This course aims to give you an easy to understand guide to the complexities of Google's TensorFlow 2 framework in a way that is easy to understand.

Section 0-2:
These three sections review numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib for data preprocessing and data visualization. 

Section 3:
Based on LendingClub DataSet from Kaggle: [Data Link](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club) an ANN model is built to predict whether a borrower will be able to pay back their loan. There are many data preprocessing operation has been done to remove unnecessary features.

Loss, validation loss vs training time diagram is attached below for model evaluation.
